## this doc is for assignment 5 -- tech sheet for Core Lab + Studio Final: Future as Systems

### ideation and prototype
My Futures as Systems project revolves around innovation, history, technological advancement, and humans acting as gods. Technology has written our world's history in blood and prejudice, and there are countless bioengineered/technological innovations built on oppression and taking advantage of minority/oppressed groups. It is important to wonder not just if we *can* achieved a scientific breakthrough, but also *if* we should be striving for that in the first place. 

As humans utilizing science, we have began playing God, fueled by greed and the need for power and control. We bend the world to our whims, and we've workshopped natural processes to fit exactly as we see fit.


### technical materials and software
I plan on using both hardware and software together, where the interactions take place in the physical object, but the responses occur in the software/on the computer. I plan on using an Arduino for all circuits, with either light sensors, or simple circuit completion for the signals that will be sent through serial port into the computer. My preliminary idea used NFC tags and a mini NFC tag reader, but I have pivoted away from that idea for this project specifically, and may implement similar ideas in other future projects. 

In terms of software, I will be using Javascript, Processing, Arduino, C++, and possibly Node.js for server/serial control. 

Considering the physical aspect of my project, I am refurbishing an old 1999 "Operation" board game for the outer shell, utilizing the plastic pieces that fit into each slot in the board game's character. If there are any missing, I can simply 3-D print them with the right dimensions using filament/PVA, and it will function the same.


If your project is speculative: What technologies (real or fictional) are you imagining for your project? How might they be documented, and what resources would be available for their use?
How do these technical choices support your concept?
What materials are you expecting to include in the final submission of your project?
If your project has a form other than a website or source code, I'm expecting technical documentation of some sort (e.g. a bill of materials, technical drawings, circuit diagrams, a user manual or so on). What form do you expect your technical documentation to take?
What topics would be helpful for us to discuss in support of your project? This can be either new topics or any material from earlier in the semester that you'd like to review.
